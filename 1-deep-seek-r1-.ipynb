# 🌐 DeepSeek-R1 + Azure AI for Infra Optimization 🚀

Welcome to the DeepSeek-R1 + Azure AI notebook for **cloud infrastructure optimization and cost-performance analysis**.

**DeepSeek-R1** is a state-of-the-art reasoning model fine-tuned with reinforcement learning and supervised training. 
It excels at analyzing complex environments—perfect for Azure infrastructure scenarios that require deep insights and decisions.

In this notebook, you'll learn how to:

1. 🔧 **Initialize** the `ChatCompletionsClient` for Azure serverless inference endpoints
2. 💬 **Chat** with DeepSeek-R1 to extract reasoning and recommendations
3. 📊 **Analyze** Azure infrastructure for cost, performance, and scalability
4. 🧠 **Leverage** the 128K context window to evaluate large-scale configurations and cost reports

---

🛠️ **Why DeepSeek-R1 for Azure Infra?**

- 🔄 **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: Ideal for evaluating multi-step cloud architectures
- 📚 **Massive Context Support**: 128,000 tokens to reason over entire reports, Bicep templates, and ARM deployments
- ⚙️ **Efficient Intelligence**: 37B active parameters focused on actionable insights
- 🔒 **Built-in Safety Filters**: Keeps recommendations reliable and secure

Use this model to simulate what an Azure Solutions Architect might do—but at scale and with speed.

Let’s dive in and optimize your Azure environment intelligently.


## 1. Setup & Authentication

Required packages:
- `azure-ai-inference`: For chat completions
- `python-dotenv`: For environment variables

.env file requirements:
```bash
AZURE_INFERENCE_ENDPOINT=<your-endpoint-url>
AZURE_INFERENCE_KEY=<your-api-key>
MODEL_NAME=DeepSeek-R1
```

import os
import re
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from azure.ai.inference import ChatCompletionsClient
from azure.ai.inference.models import SystemMessage, UserMessage
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

# Load environment
load_dotenv()
endpoint = os.getenv("AZURE_INFERENCE_ENDPOINT")
key = os.getenv("AZURE_INFERENCE_KEY")
model_name = os.getenv("MODEL_NAMEDS", "DeepSeek-R1")

# Initialize client
try:
    client = ChatCompletionsClient(
        endpoint=endpoint,
        credential=AzureKeyCredential(key),
        headers={"x-ms-model-mesh-model-name": model_name}  # Add the model name in the header
    )
    print("✅ Client initialized | Model:", client.get_model_info().model_name)
except Exception as e:
    print("❌ Initialization failed:", e)


## 3. Technical Problem Solving 💻

            UserMessage(content=f"{problem} Please reason step by step and highlight key recommendations.")
        ],
        model=model_name,
        temperature=0.3,
        max_tokens=2048
    )
    
    return response.choices[0].message.content
